<table style="border:2px solid black;border-collapse:collapse; width:80%; font-size:180%; text-align: center;">

</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Product Development</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;"> Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. 
They build predictive models for new products and services by classifying key attributes of past 
and current products or services and modeling the relationship between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. 
In addition, P&G uses data and analytics from focus groups, social media, test markets, 
and early store rollouts to plan, produce, and launch new products.</td>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Predictive Maintenance</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, 
such as the year, make, and model of equipment, as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, 
sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. By analyzing these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, 
organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively and maximize parts and equipment uptime.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Customer Experience</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">The race for customers is on. A clearer view of customer experience is more possible now than ever before. 
Big data enables you to gather data from social media, web visits, call logs, 
and other sources to improve the interaction experience and maximize the value delivered. 
Start delivering personalized offers, reduce customer churn, and handle issues proactively.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Fraud and Compliance</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">When it comes to security, it’s not just a few rogue hackers—you’re up against entire expert teams. 
Security landscapes and compliance requirements are constantly evolving. 
Big data helps you identify patterns in data that indicate fraud and aggregate large volumes of information to make regulatory reporting much faster.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Machine Learning</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Machine learning is a hot topic right now. And data—specifically big data—is one of the reasons why. 
We are now able to teach machines instead of program them. The availability of big data to train machine learning models makes that possible.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Operational Efficiency</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Operational efficiency may not always make the news, but it’s an area in which big data is having the most impact. 
With big data, you can analyze and assess production, 
customer feedback and returns, and other factors to reduce outages and anticipate future demands. 
Big data can also be used to improve decision-making in line with current market demand.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Drive Innovation</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;">Big data can help you innovate by studying interdependencies among humans, 
institutions, entities, and process and then determining new ways to use those insights. 
Use data insights to improve decisions about financial and planning considerations. 
Examine trends and what customers want to deliver new products and services. Implement dynamic pricing. There are endless possibilities.</td>
