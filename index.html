The term has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term.
Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, 
curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time. Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, 
semi-structured and structured data, however the main focus is on unstructured data. 
Big data "size" is a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.
Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data-sets that are diverse, 
complex, and of a massive scale.
